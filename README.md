## unicorn-fuzzer
This project is upgrade version of [afl-unicorn](https://github.com/Battelle/afl-unicorn). Unlike afl-unicorn project, we use c++ as a development language.


## How to use it
Write a harness in src/unicorn_loader.c. After that, you just build and excute with your context files and the binary.
